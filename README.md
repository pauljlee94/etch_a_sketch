# Etch-a-Sketch
## What it is
In this mini project, I will be making an etch-a-sketch board according to The Odin Project's project guidelines. I do want to make it a little different though. 

The project calls for the board to be colored when the mouse is hovered over each cell but I want to make it so you have to hold down the mouse button to color. I would also love to make it so the user can choose what color they can use.

I decided to veer from the course in hopes of making a very basic copy of Jenn Schiffer's make8bitart.com.

## Things I Leared
- Javascript dom manipulation
- event listeners
- Intermediate(?) CSS
- How to Google things lol

## Things I Want to Implement
- Color chooser (maybe rgb somehow?)
